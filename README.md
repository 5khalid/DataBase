<h1>A Database System for a Package Delivery Company.</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This is a project for designing and developing a database system for a package delivery company. The system should keep track of customers who send and receive packages, maintain information about company employees, and track the processing and location of each shipped package. The system should be able to store the location of the package and its history of locations, and locations include trucks, planes, airports, and warehouses. The system should be able to identify fines for delayed packages, lost, or damaged packages and send notifications whenever the packages become available for delivery, or if they are delayed.

The project is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the students should create an Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagram, a complete relational schema, a list of constraints, including primary-key and foreign-key constraints, check constraints, and not null constraints, and describe business-related constraints. In the second phase, the students should describe constraints, including business-related and technical constraints, design the database following an EER approach, go through the normalization process to come up with a collection of tables that are in Third normal forms, and populate the database by using SQL insert statements or some GUI interface.

The system's main actors are system admins and company employees, customers, and the system itself. The admin/employee can add, modify, delete packages and update movement information. The customers can search for their packages, update their personal information, make payments, and trace back their package. The system is responsible for sending notifications through email, among other functions.

The phase 1 deliverables should contain all constraints and business rules, the EER and Relational Schema, a list of tools and resources used, and a table listing the tasks done by each group member. The phase 2 deliverables should contain a description of constraints, a normalized database design, an implementation of at least one trigger, and a populated database. The system should have functions such as adding, removing, and editing package and user information, generating reports, tracing back packages, and sending notifications for the administration/employee. For the customer, the system should have functions such as searching for packages, sending/receiving packages, updating personal information, making payments, and trace backing the package. Finally, the system should generate reports on payments that have been confirmed and completed, and list all lost or damaged packages.
